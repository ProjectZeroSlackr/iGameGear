  to start the "Nibbles" game or use
  "Emulators > iGameGear > Roms" to select a rom.
- Files with a ".gg" or ".sms" extension have their default
  action set to iGameGear.
- Rom files should be placed in the "Roms" folder.
  Public domain rom files can be obtained through various
  internet websites while commercial rom files should be dumped
  from real GG/SMS game cartridges (downloading commercial
  roms that you do not own is ILLEGAL). Public domain roms can
  be found at: http://www.pdroms.de/files/gamegear/ and
